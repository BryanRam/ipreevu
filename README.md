## Ipreevu

Ipreevu is a recreation of the CSS Conference Web (<a href="https://github.com/BryanRam/conference_web" target="_blank">conference_web</a>) built in Laravel 9. It is a work in progress update from the previous version that was built in an old lightweight version of Laravel called Lumen, and configured to run in Heroku.

# Coming soon: Instructions for running Ipreevu locally
